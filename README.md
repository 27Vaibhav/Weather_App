## Introduction
The Weather Website allows users to enter a location and receive up-to-date weather information. This project demonstrates the use of web technologies and API integration to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Files
The project consists of two main files:

1. **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
2. **script.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic to fetch weather data from the API and update the web page accordingly.

## Usage
To use the Weather Website, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter the desired location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the weather information.

Ensure you have an active internet connection, as the website fetches weather data from an external API.
